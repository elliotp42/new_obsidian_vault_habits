* Start waking up based on when I want to wake up, not only  to stay in line with classes, example wake up at 6 when I have a class at 8 or 10:20 instead of 30 minutes before the class starts.
* Go on at least 3 - 1 mile runs a week as a starting point to getting back into running.
* Spend less time playing games when I am supposed to be doing something productive.
