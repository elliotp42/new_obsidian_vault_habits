Viego is an AD Fighter Jungler that is very strong in big team fights, because whenever he gets a kill, he can turn into the enemy's champion for a few seconds

**Starting Item Path**

Yun Taal's Wild Arrows --> Boots ðŸ‘¢ --> The Collector

Note: This starting build is just the one that I personally use, which makes Viego more into a Burst Damage Champion. Viego is extremely strong because you can build Viego many different ways to adjust to the enemies champions.
